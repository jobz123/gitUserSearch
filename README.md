# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app

![Design preview for the GitHub user search app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the [GitHub users API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users#get-a-user) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
